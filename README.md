# Portfolio v1.0

## What's this?

My first portfolio, built with React, to learn Tailwind, deployed on Netlify.
Made to showcase some of the first React apps I made, as well as earlier
projects built in the process of learning HTML+CSS, accessibility, and basic
programming with vanilla Javascript. There's also a couple of fullstack projects
as I started taking a look at how to setup a basic server, a CRUD api, and
connect to a database.

Features:

- responsive
- dark mode
- keyboard accessible, accessible modals
- filters by categories for projects
- none more planned at the moment. I've moved on to v2.0 with Next.js and
  Typescript and I'm trying to wrap my head around all that and fullstack apps
  now.

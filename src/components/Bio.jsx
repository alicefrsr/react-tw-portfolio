            In a previous life I was a{' '}
            <span className='jobtitle'>film editor</span> based in London for 20
            years, working on TV & feature documentaries, music promos,
            corporate videos, commercials, 2D/3D animation and VFX editing. I
            left after Brexit in pursuit of new horizons and sailing adventures,
            which led me to the CÃ´te d&#39;Azur in France, and the Costa Brava
            and Mallorca in Spain, juggling short editing contracts with my
            regular clients back in London during the winter, with working as a
            <span className='jobtitle'> deckhand, stewardess </span> and
            <span className='jobtitle'> junior engineer </span>
            on private superyachts during the summer in the Mediterranean
            (2017-2020).

            As the world shut down during the pandemic in 2020, it was a chance
            to explore what programming was all about. Two months of Python
            during lockdown got me hooked, and after tying up loose ends with
            ongoing work, I decided to commit to losing myself down the rabbit
            hole of all things web.

            Today I can&#39;t imagine doing anything else. Moving forward, I
            hope to find a professional and friendly team that will give me the
            opportunity to take my new skills to the next level so that
            together, we can build useful tools and a more inclusive and
            accessible digital world.

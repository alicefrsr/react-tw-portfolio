            based in London for 20 years, working on TV & feature documentaries,
            music promos, corporate videos and commercials. I left after Brexit
            in pursuit of new horizons, sunshine and sailing adventures, which
            led me to the CÃ´te d&#39;Azur in France, and the Costa Brava and
            Mallorca in Spain, juggling short editing contracts with my regular
            clients back in London during the winter, with working as a

            As the world shut down for a few months during the pandemic in 2020,
            it was a chance for my curious mind to see what programming was all
            about. I had already dabbled with HTML, CSS and played with a
            Raspberry Pi but 2 months of Python during lockdown got me hooked,
            and soon enough I got lost down the rabbit hole of all things web.

            Today I can&#39;t imagine doing anything else. At this stage in my
            coding journey, I&#39;m looking for a professional and friendly team
            that will give me the opportunity to take my skills to the next
            level so that together, we can build useful tools and a more
            inclusive and accessible digital world.

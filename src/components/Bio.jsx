            In a previous life I was a{' '}
            <span className='highlight'>film editor</span> based in London for
            20 years, working on TV & feature documentaries, music promos,
            corporate videos, commercials, 2D/3D animation and VFX editing. I
            left after Brexit in pursuit of new challenges and sailing
            adventures, which led me to the CÃ´te d&#39;Azur in France, the Costa
            Brava and Mallorca in Spain, juggling working as a
            <span className='highlight'> deck/stew, crew cook </span> or
            <span className='highlight'> junior engineer </span>
            on private superyachts during the summer in the Mediterranean
            (2017-2020), with short editing contracts with my regular clients
            back in London during the winter.

            As the world shut down during the pandemic in 2020, it was a chance
            to explore what <strong>programming</strong> was all about. Two
            months of Python during lockdown got me hooked. Since 2022 I've been
            focusing on building things for the web and adding to my skillset
            full-time every day.
